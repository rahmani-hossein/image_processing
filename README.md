# Image_Processing
In this repo I uploaded some of my fascinating exercises for Image Processing course at Sharif University of Technology.I passed this course with [Dr. Mostafa Kamali](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nd2wWvoAAAAJ&hl=en)
## Course Materials 
Our refrence was [Digital Image Processing](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Image-Processing-Rafael-Gonzalez/dp/0133356728). I will upload all my codes with inputs and outputs to share my work. below list is some of the codes
### 1. Hybrid Images :
### 2. Image Warping :
### 3. Hough Transform :
### 4. Texture Synthesis (Dynamic Programming) :
### 5. Slic Oversegmentation :
### 6. Mean Shift Image segmentation :
### 7. MultiResolution Image Blending (with Laplacian Stackes) :
### 8. Poisson Blending :
### 9. Image Morphing :
  for [Image Morphing](https://learnopencv.com/face-morph-using-opencv-cpp-python/), I morph Brad Pitt and Anjelina Jolie faces. for having similar points I used Facial Landmark     Detectors(dlib library) and i saved them in files(inputs/anjelina.txt and brad.txt) and with input files with same name in Inputs directory i made a film that Anjelina gradually   be Brad!
  I used Delaunay Triangularization and image warping techniques for this purpose.
